# Travel Time Web Page

This project demonstrates the use of CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating a responsive and visually appealing web layout. The web page is designed for a travel-themed site, featuring distinct sections for navigation, main content, and a footer.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: 
  - The page layout adapts seamlessly to different browser widths, ensuring a consistent experience on both large and small screens.
  - Uses CSS Grid to structure major sections, including the header, main content, and footer.

- **Flexible Content Positioning**:
  - The navigation menu remains fixed at the top of the browser window while the rest of the page content scrolls, making navigation always accessible.
  - The column widths for different sections in the main content dynamically adjust based on browser width, maintaining a proportional and readable design.

- **Image Gallery**:
  - The image gallery within the main content area utilizes Flexbox to display images in a clean and organized manner.
  - Gallery images are arranged with consistent sizing and spacing to ensure visual alignment.

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Social media icons are provided in the header section with tooltips and appropriate links for better user interaction.
  - The "Sign-In" link and navigation links have hover effects to enhance the user experience.

## Technical Implementation

- **HTML5 and CSS3**:
  - The project uses semantic HTML5 elements and follows industry best practices for web development.
  - CSS Grid is used for the main layout of the header, main content, and footer sections, ensuring precise placement and alignment.
  - Flexbox is applied to the image gallery section, allowing images to wrap and align based on available space.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - External stylesheets handle styling for larger screens, while embedded styles manage smaller viewports, making the page responsive.
  - The page layout automatically adapts based on the device width, providing a different layout for large screens and narrow screens.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Implements accessible navigation with keyboard-friendly link interactions and tooltips for additional context.
  - Uses a minimal color scheme that maintains contrast and readability.
